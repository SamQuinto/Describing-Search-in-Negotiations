      "narrative": "You and four roommates made a pact at graduation to take a trip together. Five years have passed, and that trip still has not happened. You have all stayed in touch, but you can feel yourselves slowly drifting apart. *You see this weekend trip as a chance to reconnect, but it will only happen if all of you can agree on your vacation plans.*\n\n**The current plan:**\nYou and your friends already have a drafted plan for a weekend in a nearby city. Mornings start early and efficiently, and the afternoons include one planned activity per day. Lodging-wise, everyone has separate rooms, the hotel sits closer to the mountains than the city, and you plan on getting around by car. But while there is space for an extra activity or two, there is no built-in solo time, and there are no plans to socialize with people outside of the group. Each of you wants something a little different from the current setup, so you will hop on a video call to adjust the plan until everyone feels good about going.\n\n**Issues under discussion:**\nYou’ve narrowed the conversation to 10 potential tweaks to the plan. These are, whether to have:\n- Slow mornings (or keep mornings efficient)\n- More afternoon activities (or keep it to one activity)\n- Built-in solo time in the schedule (or always stay together)\n- Shared rooms (or keep separate rooms)\n- Encounters with new people (or just stick with the group)\n- Meet-ups old friends nearby (or skip these meetups)\n- A bicycle-and-boat pass (or stick with the rental car)\n- A hotel reservation in the city (or stay near the mountains)\n- Hiking plans (or use that time on other plans)\n- Museum plans (or use that time on other plans)\n*As you prepare for the negotiation, you reflect on your general preferences for each of these issues.*\n\n**Your preferences:**\nRelaxation is your favorite part of a trip. You prefer slow mornings because you like easing into the day without a clock ruining your mood. And so, by the afternoon, you want breathing room. Too many activities turns the day into a checklist. Meeting new people sounds fun to you. It adds a bit of spontaneity and makes the weekend feel more alive. However, you would rather not schedule a meet-up with old friends. This trip is about making new memories together, not reliving old ones. Switching to shared rooms also just feels right to you. You like the little moments, late-night chats, and waking up in the same place is what you need to meaningfully reconnect. Similarly, you do not want solo time penciled into the schedule. You would prefer to have as much time together as possible.\n\nFor getting around, you want the trip to feel a bit scenic. The bicycle-and-boat pass makes the in-between moments with Mother Nature part of the experience. Hence, staying downtown is not appealing. You prefer the original hotel near the mountains, where it’s calmer and more connected to nature, even if it is a bit less central. You are fine either way on hiking. If the group wants it, you can go along. And if some people want to go to a museum, that also works fine for you.\n\n**Your Prolific Bonus ($):**\nYour preferences are captured in the points table below.

You have all stayed in touch, but you can feel yourselves slowly drifting apart. *You see this weekend trip as a chance to reconnect, but it will only happen if all of you can agree on your vacation plans.*\n\n**The current plan:**\nYou and your friends already have a drafted plan for a weekend in a nearby city. Mornings start early and efficiently, and the afternoons include one planned activity per day. Lodging-wise, everyone has separate rooms, the hotel sits closer to the mountains than the city, and you plan on getting around by car. But while there is space for an extra activity or two, there is no built-in solo time, and there are no plans to socialize with people outside of the group. Each of you wants something a little different from the current setup, so you will hop on a video call to adjust the plan until everyone feels good about going.\n\n**Issues under discussion:**\nYou’ve narrowed the conversation to 10 potential tweaks to the plan. These are, whether to have:\n- Slow mornings (or keep mornings efficient)\n- More afternoon activities (or keep it to one activity)\n- Built-in solo time in the schedule (or always stay together)\n- Shared rooms (or keep separate rooms)\n- Encounters with new people (or just stick with the group)\n- Meet-ups old friends nearby (or skip these meetups)\n- A bicycle-and-boat pass (or stick with the rental car)\n- A hotel reservation in the city (or stay near the mountains)\n- Hiking plans (or use that time on other plans)\n- Museum plans (or use that time on other plans)\n*As you prepare for the negotiation, you reflect on your general preferences for each of these issues.*\n\n**Your preferences:**\nYou like fast and efficient travel. Slow mornings feel like you are giving away the best hours. So packing in a couple of activities in the afternoon makes the day feel full in a satisfying way. Meeting new people sounds fun to you. It adds a bit of spontaneity and makes the weekend feel more alive. However, you would rather not schedule a meet-up with old friends. This trip is about making new memories together, not reliving old ones. When it comes to the hotel setup, shared or separate rooms both work for you if the setup feels fair. Similarly, solo time is optional for you. You can do it if it fits, skip it if it does not.\n\nFor getting around, you prefer to keep the rental car. You like the city roads it takes. Concrete jungles are scenic for you and you could care less about connecting with nature. Hence, in terms of where you'll be staying, being downtown sounds great. You like stepping outside and being right in the middle of city life. Outdoor activities like hiking are just not appealing to you. You like less adventurous, indoor activities. Cultural connection and being away from the outdoors sounds like a great way to spend extra vacation time.\n\n**Your Prolific Bonus ($):**\nYour preferences are captured in the points table below. Higher points mean you like that option more, and **the total points you receive *if your group reaches an agreement* will determine the amount of money you earn from Prolific.** Since it has been five years since you all lived together, your memories of each other’s travel styles may be outdated, so **maximizing your total points (and earnings) requires listening carefully and rediscovering what matters to them while still advocating for what matters most to you.**",

The bicycle-and-boat pass makes the in-between moments with Mother Nature part of the experience. Hence, staying downtown is not appealing.

  "tips": "<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">Negotiation is a skill you can get better at with practice. At its core, it is about <strong>making choices when people want different things</strong>, with each person’s decision affecting what the others get out of the deal. The good news is that <strong>a few basic ideas</strong> go a long way.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">One of the most important ideas is knowing your <strong>best alternative to reaching a deal</strong>. This is your realistic fallback plan outside the negotiation. Knowing what that alternative is actually worth helps protect you from accepting an agreement that leaves you worse off than walking away. A simple rule follows: <strong>never accept a deal worse than your best alternative</strong>.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">Another key idea is that some negotiations can be <strong>win-win</strong>. This happens when people <strong>value different issues differently</strong>. If something matters a lot to you but not as much to someone else, you may be able to trade it for something you care about more. In practice, focus less on “splitting the difference” and more on learning what the other person really wants, so you can make <strong>smart tradeoffs</strong> that leave everyone better off.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">A final tip: win-win outcomes become easier when everyone is clear on <strong>what matters most</strong>. Be explicit about what you care about and how that translates into what you want on each issue. At the same time, listen closely to what others care about too. Knowing this is what makes those smart, win-win tradeoffs possible.</p>"
