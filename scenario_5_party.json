      "narrative": "Back in college, you lived in a big house with 4 other people, a tight social group that lived and died together. You made a pact at graduation to take a trip together once your lives had gotten settled. Now five years have passed, and that trip still hasn't happened! Of course you’re all busy, but another challenge is finding a plan that feels exciting to everyone.\n\nAlthough you’ve stayed in touch and visit regularly, you can feel yourselves drifting apart, since you ended up in different cities after graduating and have since formed new social circles. You worry that it’s now or never: if you don’t take this trip soon, you don’t know when you’ll ever find the time. This trip is your chance to reconnect on a deep level, but will only happen if you can find a suitable plan.\n\n**The plan so far:**\nBroadly speaking, you share a lot of interests. This is why you’re such great friends. All of you love exploring, and none of you has really traveled outside the USA. You all like cities with nightlife, but you also want the option to dip into nature when you feel like it. That mix is what you’ve been looking for. The solution? Barcelona. You’ve been talking for years about a visit to Barcelona, a culture-rich city that stays up late, with a mountain range on one side and the coast and long beaches on the other. It’s the kind of place that sparked the pact in the first place.\n\n**Issues under discussion:**\nHowever, the devil is in the details. Although you have a lot in common, you also are very different. You became roommates first by random lottery, and then became friends later. For example, you’ve always liked to start your day slow: a coffee, a little quiet, easing into the morning. Some of your friends are the opposite and want to jump into action early.\n\nBut life is all about tradeoffs, right? You have to give a little to get a little, and you are confident that you can find a plan that works for everyone.\n\nYou’ve narrowed it down to 10 possible tweaks to the last plan. These include whether to have:\n- Slow mornings (vs early activities)\n- Multiple afternoon activities (vs just one activity)\n- Plans to meet new people (vs keeping it private)\n- Other college friends join (vs just the five of you)\n- Shared rooms (vs separate rooms)\n- Some solo activities (vs always staying together)\n- Visits to nearby towns (vs plans within the city only)\n- Hotel arrangements in the city (vs staying near the mountains)\n- A long nature excursion (vs shorter hikes only)\n- More historical tours (vs tour covering the main attractions only)\n\n*As you prepare for the negotiation, you reflect on your general preferences for each of these issues.*\n\n**Your preferences:**\nRelaxation is your favorite part of a trip. You prefer slow mornings because you like easing into the day without a clock ruining your mood. And so, by the afternoon, you want breathing room. Too many activities turns the day into a checklist.\n\nMeeting new people sounds fun. The best part is that those shared moments with new people turn into the kind of stories that always come up later when the group’s reminiscing. However, meeting your other college friends sounds like a chore. You didn’t really like them that much, and you’d honestly rather spend time with strangers than with them.\n\nSharing rooms just feels right to you. You like the late-night chats and the small moments, and waking up in the same place is how the weekend actually feels like time together. You also don’t want solo activities explicitly planned. The whole purpose of this trip is to spend more time together.\n\nIdeally, you’d love to see some of the nearby towns. Visiting somewhere like Tarragona, or seeing the villages surrounding the mountain range feels much more exciting than only staying in the city. That’s why you’d prefer being closer to the mountains rather than the city. It’s calmer, and it’s closer to the natural park, and to the other towns you could visit.\n\nYou’re flexible on a long nature excursion. If the group is excited you can go along, and if not, that’s fine too. It’s the same for the history tours. You don’t hate having more of them, but they’re not something you need to make this trip feel special.\n\n**Your Prolific Bonus ($):**\nYour preferences are captured in the points table below. Higher points mean you like that option more, and **the total points you receive *if your group reaches an agreement* will determine the amount of money you earn from Prolific.** Since it has been five years since you all lived together, your memories of each other’s travel styles may be outdated, so **maximizing your total points (and earnings) requires listening carefully and rediscovering what matters to them while still advocating for what matters most to you.**",

      "narrative": "Back in college, you lived in a big house with 4 other people, a tight social group that lived and died together. You made a pact at graduation to take a trip together once your lives had gotten settled. Now five years have passed, and that trip still hasn't happened! Of course you’re all busy, but another challenge is finding a plan that feels exciting to everyone.\n\nAlthough you’ve stayed in touch and visit regularly, you can feel yourselves drifting apart, since you ended up in different cities after graduating and have since formed new social circles. You worry that it’s now or never: if you don’t take this trip soon, you don’t know when you’ll ever find the time. This trip is your chance to reconnect on a deep level, but will only happen if you can find a suitable plan.\n\n**The plan so far:**\nBroadly speaking, you share a lot of interests. This is why you’re such great friends. All of you love exploring, and none of you has really traveled outside the USA. You all like cities with nightlife, but you also want the option to dip into nature when you feel like it. That mix is what you’ve been looking for. The solution? Barcelona. You’ve been talking for years about a visit to Barcelona, a culture-rich city that stays up late, with a mountain range on one side and the coast and long beaches on the other. It’s the kind of place that sparked the pact in the first place.\n\n**Issues under discussion:**\nHowever, the devil is in the details. Although you have a lot in common, you also are very different. You became roommates first by random lottery, and then became friends later. For example, you like fast and efficient travel. Slow mornings feel like you are giving away the best hours. Some of your friends prefer the opposite and want a slower start.\n\nBut life is all about tradeoffs, right? You have to give a little to get a little, and you are confident that you can find a plan that works for everyone.\n\nYou’ve narrowed it down to 10 possible tweaks to the last plan. These include whether to have:\n- Slow mornings (vs early activities)\n- Multiple afternoon activities (vs just one activity)\n- Plans to meet new people (vs keeping it private)\n- Other college friends join (vs just the five of you)\n- Shared rooms (vs separate rooms)\n- Some solo activities (vs always staying together)\n- Visits to nearby towns (vs plans within the city only)\n- Hotel arrangements in the city (vs staying near the mountains)\n- A long nature excursion (vs shorter hikes only)\n- More historical tours (vs tour covering the main attractions only)\n\n*As you prepare for the negotiation, you reflect on your general preferences for each of these issues.*\n\n**Your preferences:**\nYou like fast and efficient travel. Slow mornings feel like you are giving away the best hours. Packing in a couple of activities in the afternoon makes just the day feel much more satisfying.\nMeeting new people sounds fun. The best part is that those shared moments with new people turn into the kind of stories that always come up later when the group’s reminiscing. However, meeting your other college friends sounds like a chore. You didn’t really like them that much, and you’d honestly rather spend time with strangers than with them.\nWhen it comes to rooms, shared or separate both work for you, as long as everyone feels good about the setup and is excited for the day’s plans. Similarly, solo activities are optional for you. You’re fine with some independence if it fits, and fine keeping everything shared if it doesn't.\nYou’d rather not leave the city for nearby towns. There’s just so much to see within Barcelona itself, and going outside feels taxing and not that exciting. That’s why you want a hotel in or near the city. It lets you see more of the city, and anchors the group away from checking out nearby towns.\nA longer nature excursion isn’t appealing to you. You’d rather avoid committing a big block of time to something outdoors-heavy. Instead, you’d enjoy doing more historical and cultural tours. There are so many guided walks, landmarks, and cultural sites to visit, but only so little time.\n\n**Your Prolific Bonus ($):**\nYour preferences are captured in the points table below. Higher points mean you like that option more, and **the total points you receive *if your group reaches an agreement* will determine the amount of money you earn from Prolific.** Since it has been five years since you all lived together, your memories of each other’s travel styles may be outdated, so **maximizing your total points (and earnings) requires listening carefully and rediscovering what matters to them while still advocating for what matters most to you.**",

  "tips": "<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">Negotiation is a skill you can get better at with practice. At its core, it is about making choices when people want different things, with each person’s decision affecting what the others get out of the deal. The good news is that a few basic ideas go a long way.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">One of the most important ideas is knowing your <strong>best alternative</strong> to negotiating an agreement, or your <strong>BATNA</strong>. This is your realistic fallback plan outside the negotiation. Knowing what that alternative is <strong>actually worth</strong> helps protect you from accepting an agreement that leaves you worse off than walking away. A simple rule follows from this: <strong>never accept a deal worse than your BATNA</strong>.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">Another key idea is that some negotiations can be <strong>win-win</strong>. This happens when people value different issues differently. If something matters a lot to you but not as much to the other person, you may be able to <strong>trade it for something you care about more</strong>. In practice, this means focusing less on “splitting the difference” and more on <strong>learning what the other person really wants</strong>, so you can make smart tradeoffs that leave both of you better off.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">A final tip is that <strong>win-win outcomes become easier to achieve when everyone knows what matters most to each party</strong> . So try to be clear about what you care about, and how these interests translate to what you want across each issue under negotiation.
