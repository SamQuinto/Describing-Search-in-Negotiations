      "narrative": "You and one roommate made a pact at graduation to take a trip together. Five years have passed, and that trip still has not happened. You have both stayed in touch, but you can feel yourselves slowly drifting apart. You see this weekend trip as a chance to reconnect, but it will only happen if you can both agree on your vacation plans.\n\n<strong>The current plan:</strong>\nYou and your friend already have a drafted plan for a weekend in a nearby city. Mornings start early and efficiently, and the afternoons include one planned activity per day. Lodging-wise, you have separate rooms, the hotel sits closer to the mountains than the city, and you plan on getting around by car. But while there is space for an extra activity or two, there is no built-in solo time, and there are no plans to socialize with people outside of the two of you. You each want something a little different from the current setup, so you will hop on a video call to adjust the plan until you both feel good about going.\n\n<strong>Your task:</strong>\nYou have narrowed the changes worth discussing into ten issues. These cover whether mornings should be slow or stay efficient, whether afternoons should include more activities, how much time you spend together versus having time to yourselves, whether moving from separate to shared rooms feels right, and whether to meet new people in town or reconnect with old nearby friends. In terms of your ideal travel scenery and activities, you will also discuss whether to buy a bicycle-and-boat pass that lets you enjoy nature a bit more than renting a car, whether to relocate downtown to feel closer to city life, and whether extra time should be spent hiking outdoors or visiting a museum. <em>As you prepare for the negotiation, you reflect on your general preferences for each of these issues.</em>\n\n<strong>Your preferences:</strong>\n[P1: Slow mornings; fewer afternoon activities; meet new people; skip old-friend meetups; shared rooms; no scheduled solo time; scenic bicycle-and-boat pass; avoid downtown hotel; neutral on hiking and museum]\nRelaxation is your favorite part of a trip. You prefer slow mornings because you like easing into the day without a clock ruining your mood. And so, by the afternoon, you want breathing room. Too many activities turn the day into a checklist. Meeting new people sounds fun to you. It adds a bit of spontaneity and makes the weekend feel more alive. However, you would rather not schedule a meet-up with old friends. This trip is about making new memories together, not reliving old ones. Switching to shared rooms also just feels right to you. You like the little moments, late-night chats, and waking up in the same place is what you need to meaningfully reconnect. Similarly, you do not want solo time penciled into the schedule. You would prefer to have as much time together as possible.\n\nFor getting around, you want the trip to feel a bit scenic. The bicycle-and-boat pass makes the in-between moments with Mother Nature part of the experience. Hence, staying downtown is not appealing. You prefer the original hotel near the mountains, where it’s calmer and more connected to nature, even if it is a bit less central. You are fine either way on hiking. If your friend wants it, you can go along. And if some people want to go to a museum, that also works fine for you.\n\n<strong>Important: Your Prolific Bonus ($):</strong>\nYour preferences across each vacation issue are reflected in the points table below. Higher points mean greater satisfaction for you if that feature becomes part of the plan, and <strong>the total points you receive if your group reaches an agreement will determine the amount of money you earn from Prolific.</strong> It's important to note that this trip is all-or-nothing: if you cannot both agree on a plan that gives each person a positive score, you would each rather spend the week visiting your parents instead, which is worth <em>zero points</em> but still feels like a proper break.\n\nSince it has been five years since you both lived together, whatever you remember about your friend’s travel style may no longer be accurate. You might line up on some issues and clash on others, so <strong>maximizing your total points (and earnings) requires listening carefully and rediscovering what matters to them while still advocating for what matters most to you.</strong>",

Slow mornings feel like you are giving away the best hours. Consistently, packing in a couple of activities in the afternoon makes the day feel full in a satisfying way. Meeting new people can feel like work, and you do not want to deal with that during a vacation. However, if the weekend includes familiar faces, you are into it. Seeing old friends feels easy, meaningful, and low-pressure. When it comes to the idea of sharing rooms, you'd rather have your own private space to socially recharge and be able to meaningfully connect during the day’s activities with your friend. Similarly, you would appreciate some built-in solo time each day. It helps you reset and come back feeling fresh.\n\nYou do not have strong feelings about renting a car or getting a bicycle-and-boat pass as long as you get to your destination. Hotel location is also not a big lever for you. Either works if logistics are smooth. Outdoor activities like hiking are just not appealing to you. You like less adventurous, indoor activities. Cultural connection and being away from the outdoors sounds like a great way to spend extra vacation time.\n\n<strong>Important: Your Prolific Bonus ($):</strong>\nYour preferences across each vacation issue are reflected in the points table below.

  "tips": "<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">Negotiation is a skill that can be learned and improved with practice. At its core, negotiation is about making choices under conditions of <strong>interdependence</strong>: two or more parties want something, and each party's success depends, at least in part, on the decisions of the others. While the art of negotiation can seem daunting, there are several fundamental concepts that provide a foundation for effective bargaining. Understanding these concepts can help negotiators achieve better outcomes and avoid common pitfalls.</p><p>One of the most important ideas in negotiation is the concept of <strong>BATNA</strong> and <strong>reservation price</strong>. BATNA stands for \"Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement.\" It is essentially your fallback option—the \"thing\" you will pursue if the current negotiation fails. Your BATNA is not just abstract; it is the concrete alternative that protects you from agreeing to a deal that leaves you worse off than your options outside the negotiation. Closely related is the <strong>reservation price</strong>, which is the value of your BATNA quantified. It represents the minimum acceptable deal you are willing to accept.</p><p>The number one rule of negotiation is simple: <strong>never accept a deal worse than your BATNA</strong>! Knowing your BATNA and reservation price gives you a clear boundary and helps prevent you from making poor concessions under pressure.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">Another fundamental concept is the possibility of <strong>integrative negotiation</strong>, which is when you create value or \"expand the pie\" within a deal rather than simply dividing a fixed amount of pie. The key insight is that what matters a lot to you may matter less to someone else. By identifying these differences in priorities, negotiators can make strategic tradeoffs: conceding on issues that are low priority to gain on issues that are high priority. This approach transforms negotiation from a zero-sum battle into an opportunity for mutual gain, where both parties can walk away better off than if they had simply split the difference.</p>"
