      "narrative": "You and one roommate made a pact at graduation to take a trip together. Five years have passed, and that trip still has not happened. You have both stayed in touch, but you can feel yourselves slowly drifting apart. *You see this weekend trip as a chance to reconnect, but it will only happen if you can both agree on your vacation plans.*\n\n**The current plan:**\nYou and your friend already have a drafted plan for a weekend in a nearby city. Mornings start early and efficiently, and the afternoons include one planned activity per day. Lodging-wise, everyone has separate rooms, the hotel sits closer to the mountains than the city, and you plan on getting around by car. But while there is space for an extra activity or two, there is no built-in solo time, and there are no plans to socialize with people outside of the group. You each want something a little different from the current setup, so you will hop on a video call to adjust the plan until you both feel good about going.\n\n**Issues under discussion:**\nYou’ve narrowed the conversation to 10 potential tweaks to the plan. These are, whether to have:\n- Slow mornings (or keep mornings efficient)\n- More afternoon activities (or keep it to one activity)\n- Built-in solo time in the schedule (or always stay together)\n- Shared rooms (or keep separate rooms)\n- Encounters with new people (or stick to not meeting new people)\n- Meet-ups old friends nearby (or skip old-friend meetups)\n- A bicycle-and-boat pass (or stick with the rental car)\n- A hotel reservation in the city (or stay near the mountains)\n- Hiking Plans (or use that time on other plans)\n- Museum Plans (or use that time on other plans)\n*As you prepare for the negotiation, you reflect on your general preferences for each of these issues.*\n\n\n\n**Your Preferences:**\n\nRelaxation is your favorite part of a trip. You prefer slow mornings because you like easing into the day without a clock ruining your mood. And so, by the afternoon, you want breathing room. Too many activities turns the day into a checklist. Meeting new people sounds fun to you. It adds a bit of spontaneity and makes the weekend feel more alive. However, you would rather not schedule a meet-up with old friends. This trip is about making new memories together, not reliving old ones. Switching to shared rooms also just feels right to you. You like the little moments, late-night chats, and waking up in the same place is what you need to meaningfully reconnect. Similarly, you do not want solo time penciled into the schedule. You would prefer to have as much time together as possible.\n\nFor getting around, you want the trip to feel a bit scenic. The bicycle-and-boat pass makes the in-between moments with Mother Nature part of the experience. Hence, staying downtown is not appealing. You prefer the original hotel near the mountains, where it’s calmer and more connected to nature, even if it is a bit less central. You are fine either way on hiking. If your friend wants it, you can go along. And if they want to go to a museum, that also works fine for you.\n\n**Important: Your Prolific Bonus ($):**\nYour preferences are captured in the points table below.

Slow mornings feel like you are giving away the best hours. So packing in a couple of activities in the afternoon makes the day feel full in a satisfying way. Meeting new people can feel like work, and you do not want to deal with that during a vacation. However, if the weekend includes familiar faces, you are into it. Seeing old friends feels easy, meaningful, and low-pressure. When it comes to the idea of sharing rooms, you'd rather have your own private space to socially recharge and be able to meaningfully connect during the day’s activities with your friend. Similarly, you would appreciate some built-in solo time each day. It helps you reset and come back feeling fresh.\n\nYou do not have strong feelings about renting a car or getting a bicycle-and-boat pass as long as you get to your destination. Hotel location is also not a big lever for you. Either works if logistics are smooth. Outdoor activities like hiking are just not appealing to you. You like less adventurous, indoor activities. Cultural connection and being away from the outdoors sounds like a great way to spend extra vacation time.\n\n**Important: Your Prolific Bonus ($):**\nYour preferences are captured in the points table below.

  "tips": "<p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">Negotiation is a skill you can get better at with practice. At its core, it is about making choices when two or more people want different things, and each person’s outcome depends on what the others decide too. The good news is that a few basic ideas go a long way.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">One of the most important ideas is knowing your <strong>best alternative if you do not reach a deal</strong>. This is your realistic fallback plan outside the negotiation. Knowing what that alternative is worth helps protect you from accepting an agreement that leaves you worse off than walking away. A simple rule follows from this: <strong>never accept a deal worse than your best alternative</strong>.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">Another key idea is that some negotiations can be <strong>win-win</strong>. This happens when people value different issues differently. If something matters a lot to you but not as much to the other person, you may be able to trade it for something you care about more. In practice, this means focusing less on “splitting the difference” and more on learning what the other person really wants, so you can make smart tradeoffs that leave both of you better off.</p><p class=\"text-gray-700 mb-4\">A final tip: win-win outcomes become easier to achieve when everyone knows what matters most to each party. So try to be clear about what you care about, and how those interests translate into what you want across each issue under negotiation. Likewise, listen closely to what the other person cares about too. Knowing these things is what makes smart, win-win tradeoffs possible.</p>"
